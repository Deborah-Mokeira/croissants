  <p>A croissant is a French pastry that is made of layered, buttery dough that is rolled and folded multiple times to create a flaky texture. The dough is shaped into a crescent shape, and then baked until golden brown. Croissants can be served plain or filled with a variety of sweet or savory ingredients, such as chocolate, almond paste, ham and cheese, or spinach and feta. Croissants are typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack, and are enjoyed all over the world. They originated in Austria and were introduced to France in the 19th century, where they became an iconic French pastry.</p>
